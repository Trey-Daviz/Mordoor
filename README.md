# Mordoor
Mordoor is a portfolio project designed for displaying skills, not intended for real world use.  This project was initially developed using a Python UI package called kivy for a Software Engineering course.  Since that course, Trey Davis has scrapped and rewritten the backend to operate using API endpoints accessed through a web app instead of a kivy UI for ease of development.  He also set about creating a secure state machine for the back end and several decorators to ensure that the project was object oriented.  Michael Kraxberger and Trey Davis plan on updating the front end HTML and CSS to use an Angular framework instead of its current plain text.
